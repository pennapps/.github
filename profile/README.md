PennApps is the world's original college hackathon, hosting both a spring and a fall hackathon. Find out more about us at [pennapps.com](https://pennapps.com/).

Here on our GitHub, you'll find the source code to some of the websites you'll interact with throughout the hackathon. Please contact [audrey@pennapps.com](mailto:audrey@pennapps.com) or file an issue in the repositories if you would like to leave any feedback.
